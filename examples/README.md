# Reference Code for running DyNAS-T

This section contains examples (or templates) that show how to integrate DyNAS-T search with an arbitrary supernetwork platform. 
Definitions of the filenames:
* Full = subnetwork search using pre-trained predictors
* Warm = subnetwork search using pre-trained predictors starting from a 'warm' population
* Concurrent = ConcurrentNAS approach to subnetwork search
