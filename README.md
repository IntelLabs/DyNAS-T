# DyNAS-T

DyNAS-T (**Dy**namic **N**eural **A**rchitecture **S**earch **T**oolkit) is a super-network neural architecture
search NAS optimization package designed for efficiently discovering optimal deep neural network (DNN)
architectures for a variety of performance objectives such as accuracy, latency, multiply-and-accumulates,
and model size.

## Background

Neural architecture search, the study of automating the discovery of optimal deep neural network architectures for tasks in domains such as computer vision and natural language processing, has seen rapid growth in the machine learning research community. The computational overhead of evaluating DNN architectures during the neural architecture search process can be very costly due to the training and validation cycles. To address the training overhead, novel weight-sharing approaches known as one-shot or super-networks [1] have offered a way to mitigate the training overhead by reducing training times from thousands to a few GPU days. These approaches train a task-specific super-network architecture with a weight-sharing mechanism that allows the sub-networks to be treated as unique individual architectures. This enables sub-network model extraction and validation without a separate training cycle.

To learn more about super-networks and how to define/train them, please see our [super-network tutorial](notebooks/Supernet_Tutorial.ipynb).

## Algorithms

Evolutionary algorithms, specifically genetic algorithms, have a history of usage in NAS and continue to gain popularity as a highly efficient way to explore the architecture objective space. DyNAS-T supports a wide range of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) such as NSGA-II [2] by leveraging the [pymoo](https://pymoo.org/) library.

A unique capability of DyNAS-T is the Lightweight Iterative NAS (LINAS) that pairs evolutionary algorithms with lightly trained objective predictors in an iterative cycle to accelerate architectural exploration [3]. This technique is ~4x more sample efficient than typical one-shot predictor-based NAS approaches.

The following number of optimization algorithms are supported by DyNAS-T in both standard and LINAS formats.

| 1 Objective<br>(Single-Objective) | 2 Objectives<br>(Multi-Objective) | 3 Objectives<br>(Many-Objective) |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| GA* `'ga'`   | NSGA-II* `'nsga2'` | UNSGA-II* `'unsga3'`     |
| CMA-ES `'cmaes'` | AGE-MOEA `'age'` | CTAEA `'ctaea'`         |
|        |          | MOEAD `'moead'`          |
*Recommended for stability of search results

> **_ImageNet:_**  When using any of the OFA super-networks, the ImageNet directory tree should have a separate directory for each of the classes in both `train` and `val` sets. To prepare your ImageNet dataset for use with OFA you could follow instructions available [here](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/ilsvrc2012-in-digits/).

> **_WMT En-De:_** To obtain and prepare dataset please follow instructions available [here](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/hardware-aware-transformers).

## Intel Library Support
The following software libraries are compatible with DyNAS-T:
* [Intel Neural Compressor (INC)](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/examples/notebook/dynas/MobileNetV3_Supernet_NAS.ipynb)
* [Intel OpenVINO NNCF BootstrapNAS](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/nncf/experimental/torch/nas/bootstrapNAS/BootstrapNAS.md) (Work-in-progress)

# Getting Started

To setup DyNAS-T from source code run `pip install -e .` or make a local copy of the `dynast` subfolder in your
local subnetwork repository with the `requirements.txt` dependencies installed.

You can also install DyNAS-T from PyPI:

```bash
pip install dynast
```

Installing DyNAS-T with `pip` will make a `dynast` command available in your CLI.


## Running DyNAS-T
The `dynast/cli.py` (you can use `dynast` command to invoke this script) template provide a starting point for running the NAS process. An evaluation is the process of determining the fitness of an architectural candidate. A *validation* evaluation is the costly process of running the full validation set. A *predictor* evaluation uses a pre-trained performance predictor.

* `supernet` - Name of the pre-trained super-network. See list of supported super-networks. For a custom super-network, you will have to modify the code including the `dynast_manager.py` and `supernetwork_registry.py` files.
* `optimization_metrics` - These are the metrics that the NAS process optimizes for. Note that the number of objectives you specify must be compatible with the supporting algorithm.
* `measurements` - In addition to the optimization metrics, you can specify which measurements you would like to take during an full evaluation.
* `search_tactic` - `linas` Lightweight iterative NAS (recommended) or `evolutionary` (good for benchmarking and testing new super-networks).
* `search_algo` - Determines which evolutionary algorithm to run for the `linas` low-fidelity inner loop or the `evolutionary` search tactic.
* `num_evals` - Number of evaluations (full validation measurements) to take. For example, if 1 validation measurement takes 5 minutes, 120 evaluations would take 10 hours.
* `seed` - Random seed.
* `population` - The size of the pool of candidates for each evolutionary generation. *50* is recommended for most cases, though this can be treated as a tunable hyperparameter.
* `results_path` - The location of the csv file that store information of the DNN candidates during the search process. The csv file is used for plotting NAS results.
* `dataset_path` - Location of the dataset used for training the super-network of interest.

### Distributed Search

Search can be performed with multiple workers using the `MPI` / `torch.distributed` library. To use this functionality, your script should be called with `mpirun`/`mpiexec` command and an additional `--distributed` param has to be set (`DyNAS([...], distributed=True`).

> Note: When run with `torchrun`, unless explicitly specified, `torch.distributed` uses `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` ([link](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/commit/1c0309a9a924e34803bf7e8975f7ce88fb845131)) which may result in slow evaluation time. Good practice is to explicitly set `OMP_NUM_THREADS`  to `(total_core_count)/(num_workers)` (optional for MPI).

*Example 4.* Distributed NAS process with two OpenMPI workers for the OFA MobileNetV3-w1.0 super-network that optimizes for ImageNet Top-1 accuracy *and* model size (parameters)

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=28 mpirun \
    --report-bindings \
    -x MASTER_ADDR=127.0.0.1 \
    -x MASTER_PORT=1234 \
    -np 2 \
    -bind-to socket \
    -map-by socket \
    dynast \
        --supernet ofa_mbv3_d234_e346_k357_w1.0 \
         --optimization_metrics accuracy_top1 macs \
        --results_path results.csv \
        --search_tactic linas \
        --distributed \
        --population 50 \
        --num_evals 250
```
